# A feature-assisted Deep Neural Network for the Prediction of Cardiac Arrhythmia from ECG Signal

An irregular heart rhythm known as cardiac arrhythmia is a prominent clinical 
condition in cardiology. In this study, a powerful feature-assisted deep neural network (DNN) 
model was suggested to identify various rhythm types from a recent ECG database. 


## Dataset

A 12-lead electrocardiogram database for arrhythmia research covering more than 10,000 patients.
